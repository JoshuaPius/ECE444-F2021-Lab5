## Activity 3: Make the following changes in HTML files
Screenshot of the main page and search page. 
I noticed afterward that I made a mistake and did not properly bold the field label. I had completed activity 4 before realizing this. You will notice the update in future images but not the below images in this activity.

## Activity 6: Commit all changes
The results table is the feature I will be speaking on. The initial UI made the information in this section impossible to follow there were no line separation/borders. The text in course description for multiple courses would blend together. However, now the information is very well presented, the color coding makes it appealing to look at and the information doesn't seem as intimidating and disorganized. Also the section is titled which adds a much needed level of clarity.
